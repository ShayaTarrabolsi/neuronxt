# NeuroNXT
**Symbolic Cognition Diagnostics for Trauma and Early Neurodegeneration**

NeuroNXT is a youth-built AI system designed to detect early cognitive collapse through symbolic language modeling and EEG-based pattern analysis.  
It helps clinicians and humanitarian teams identify signs of PTSD, disassociation, or neurodegenerative decline—*before memory visibly fails*.

 the project now operates at the intersection of trauma and AI
